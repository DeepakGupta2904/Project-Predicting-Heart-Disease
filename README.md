# Project-Predicting-Heart-Disease

I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Intellipaat Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

Technologies:- Data Science

Domain:- Heathcare

Tools:- Python (Juipter Notebook)

Problem Statement:- You are the data scientist at a medical research facility. The facility wants you to build a machine learning model to classify if the given data of a patient should tell if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack.

Heart Disease Dataset:-
UCI Heart Disease Dataset
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease?spm=5176.100239.blogcont54260.8.TRNGoO)

Tasks To Be Performed:-
 1. Data Analysis:-

 a. Import the dataset
 
 b. Get information about the dataset (mean, max, min, quartiles etc.)
 
 c. Find the correlation between all fields
 
 2. Data Visualization:-

 a. Visualize the number of patients having a heart disease and not having a heart disease
 
 b. Visualize the age and whether a patient has disease or not
 
 c. Visualize correlation between all features using a heat map
 
 3. Logistic Regression:-
 
 a. Build a simple logistic regression model:-
 
 i. Divide the dataset in 70:30 ratio
 
 ii. Build the model on train set and predict the values on test set
 
 iii. Build the confusion matrix and get the accuracy score
